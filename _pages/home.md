<blockquote align=center style="font-size:1.5em;text-align: justify;"><b>Summary:</b> To improve benchmarking of <b>speech-driven gesture generation</b>, we are developing the online GENEA Leaderboard based on <b>large-scale human evaluation</b>.
This is a cross between the previous <a href="https://svito-zar.github.io/GENEAchallenge2023/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GENEA Challenges in gesture generation</a>
and recent leaderboards in NLP and computer vision, such as <a href="https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Chatbot Arena</a>

**(For comprehensive details regarding our current evaluation, please visit our [Details](/leaderboard//details) page.)**

As a living benchmark, the GENEA Leaderboard will be developed in an iterative manner over time.

Our current plans for the very first public release are the following:
* The Leaderboard will be based on the body movements of the BEAT-2 dataset in the SMPL-X format. Facial expressions will not be considered for now.
* We will accept model submissions, in the form of synthetic SMPL-X motion data generated from the test inputs of the above dataset, until the end of **2025 January**.
* The human evaluation methodology will initially only measure **motion quality** and **motion-speech appropriateness**, as defined in the GENEA Challenge 2023.
* The first set of evaluation results will be released in **2025 March**.

After the first results are published, we will keep the Leaderboard open for submissions throughout the year, and we will continuously update the ranking and publish new resources (e.g., votes and rendered videos).

<h1 align=center style="color: #3979c0">Who are we?</h1>
Our international team includes **leading experts on the evaluation of gesture-generation models**, as well as **experienced model developers** and **research engineers** with experience in deploying gesture-generation models. 
We are building this leaderboard to advance the scientific field of gesture generation, equally serving the perspectives of both academic and industrial researchers, as well as senior scientists and upcoming PhD students.
